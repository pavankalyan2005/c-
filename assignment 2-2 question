create a class named 'rectangle' with two data members length and breadth and a function to calculate area which is 'length * breadth'.
the class has three constructors which are :
1-no parameter- values of both length and breadth are assigned Zero.
2-two parameters- two values are assigned as length and breadth respectively.
3-one parameter- both length and breadth with same value 
create objects  of 'rectangle' class having none, one and two  parameters and print its area.

A)#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class Rectangle{
private:
int length;
int breadth;
public:
Rectangle(){
length =0; 
breadth=0;
} 
Rectangle(int l,int b){
length =0;
breadth =0;
}
Rectangle(int side){
length=side;
breadth=side;
}
int calculateArea(){
return length * breadth;
};
int main(){
Rectangle rect 1;
Rectangle rect 2(3,3);
Rectangle rect 3(3);
cout<<"Area :"<<rect1.calculate Area()<<endl;
cout<<"Area :"<<rect2.calculate Area()<<endl;
cout<<"Area :"<<rect3.calculate Area()<<endl;
return 0;
}
